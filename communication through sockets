where one device acts as the server and listens for incoming connections, while the other device acts as the client and connects to the server to exchange messages.
server Setup:

     The server creates a socket object and binds it to a specific IP address and port number.
     The server listens for incoming connections using the listen() method.
     Once a client connects, the server accepts the connection using the accept() method.

client Setup:

    The client creates a socket object.
    The client uses the socket's connect() method to establish a connection with the server, providing the server's IP address and port number.

message Exchange:

    The client and server can send and receive messages using the socket's send() and recv() methods.
    The sender encodes the message into bytes before sending it, and the receiver decodes the received bytes back into a string.
    Messages can be sent in both directions, allowing for bidirectional communication.
if message is quit then close connection.
